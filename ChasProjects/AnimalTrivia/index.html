            <p class="description">The <b>Amur leopard</b> (Panthera pardus orientalis) is a leopard subspecies native
              to
              the Primorye region of southeastern Russia and northern China. It is listed as Critically Endangered on
              the IUCN
              Red List. In 2007, only 19–26 wild leopards were estimated to survive in southeastern Russia and
              northeastern
              China. It was considered as one of the rarest cats on Earth.
              As of 2015, fewer than 60 individuals were estimated to survive in Russia and China. Camera-trapping
              surveys
              conducted between 2014 and 2015 revealed 92 individuals in a 8,398 km2 (3,242 sq mi) large transboundary
              area
              along the Russian-Chinese border.
              Results of genetic research indicate that the Amur leopard is genetically close to leopards in northern
              China
              and Korea, suggesting that the leopard population in this region became fragmented in the early 20th
              century.
              The North Chinese leopard was formerly recognised as a distinct subspecies P. p. japonensis, but was
              subsumed
              under the Amur leopard in 2017.</p>

            <h2 class="characteristics">Characteristics:</h2>
            <p class="description">The Amur leopard differs from other leopard subspecies by its thick fur that is
              pale
              cream-colored, particularly in winter. Rosettes on the flanks are 5 cm × 5 cm (2.0 in × 2.0 in) and
              widely
              spaced, up to 2.5 cm (0.98 in), with thick, unbroken rings and darkened centers. Its fur is fairly soft
              with
              long and dense hair. The length of hair on the back is 20–25 mm (0.79–0.98 in) in summer and up to 70 mm
              (2.8 in) in winter. The winter coat varies from fairly light yellow to dense yellowish-red with a golden
              tinge
              or rusty-reddish-yellow. In summer, the fur is brighter with more vivid coloration pattern. It is rather
              small
              in body size, with males larger than females. Males measure from 107–136 cm (42–54 in) with a 82–90 cm
              (32–35 in) long tail, a shoulder height of 64–78 cm (25–31 in), and a weight of 32.2–48 kg (71–106 lb).
              Females
              weigh from 25–42.5 kg (55–94 lb).
              The North Chinese leopard was first described on the basis of a single tanned skin, which was fulvous
              above and
              pale beneath with large roundish, oblong black spots on the back and limbs, and small black spots on the
              head.
              The spots on the back, shoulders and sides formed a ring around a central fulvous spot. The black spots
              on
              the
              nape were elongated, and large ones on the chest formed a necklace. The tail was spotted and had four
              black
              rings at the tip.</p>

            <h2 class="threats">Threats:</h2>
            <p class="description">The Amur leopard is threatened by poaching, poaching of prey species, habitat
              loss and deforestation or exploitation of forests. Its natural habitat is threatened by forest fires and
              construction of new roads. Due to the small number of reproducing Amur leopards in the wild, the gene
              pool is so
              reduced that the population is at risk from inbreeding depression. In 2015, a wild Amur leopard was
              found
              with canine distemper virus in Primorskii Krai. The small population is possibly exposed to domestic or
              wild
              disease carriers and transmitters. Tigers can eliminate leopards if densities of large and medium-sized
              prey
              species are low. Competition between these predators supposedly decreases in summer, when small prey
              species are
              more available. In winter, conditions are less favorable for tigers and the extent of trophic niche
              overlap with
              that of leopards probably reaches its peak.</p>
            <h6>Poaching</h6>
            <p>Poaching of leopards is a main threat to their survival. There are rumours but no evidence that Chinese
              traders
              buy leopard skins; no skins were confiscated at borders to China. In 14 months from February 2002 to
              April
              2003,
              seven skins or part of skins were confiscated, six in Russia and one in China. Leopards are most often
              killed by
              local Russians from small villages in and around the leopard habitat. Most of these villagers hunt
              entirely
              illegally; they have no licenses for hunting nor for their guns, and they are not members of one of the
              local
              hunting leases.
              In 1999, skins of poached leopards were offered for $500–1,000 near a protected area in Russia.</p>
            <h6>Forest degradation</h6>
            <p>Human induced fires are a main threat to the survival of the leopard. Setting fire to fields is a habit
              of
              rural farmers who start them for a particular purpose such as improving fertility for livestock grazing,
              killing
              ticks and other insects, making scrap metals visible so that they can be easily collected, culling
              vegetation
              along train tracks, and stimulating fern growth. Young ferns are sold in shops, served in restaurants
              and
              also
              exported to China as a popular dish. Surveys using satellite images and GIS techniques revealed that on
              average
              19% of south-west Primorye burns annually, and a total of 46% burned at least once in six years. Due to
              a
              long
              and frequent fire history, much of the land in south-west Primorye has been converted to permanent
              grasslands.
              These frequent fires cause degradation of suitable leopard habitat into unsuitable habitat. Repeated
              fires
              have
              created open "savannah" landscapes with grass, oak bushes and isolated trees that leopards seem to
              avoid,
              again
              probably because of low ungulate densities.[32]
              Large deer farms extended over thousands of hectares in leopard habitat. Deer farming used to be a
              large-scale
              business;the velvet of deer antlers was sold to Asian pharmacies.[31] The number of deer farms decreased
              considerably since the late 1990s. </p>
            <h6>Development projects</h6>
            <p>A number of plans for economic activities in south-west Primorye were developed that posed a serious
              threat to
              the leopard's survival. A plan to build an oil pipeline from central Siberia through Primorye to the
              coast
              of
              the Sea of Japan has been shelved. A plan for an open pit coal mine in the heart of the leopard range
              was
              not
              carried out following pressure from environmentalists and the Ministry of Natural Resources. The
              strategic
              location of south-west Primorye, close to the main population centres of Primorsky Krai, the Japanese
              Sea
              and
              the borders of Korea and China, makes it more attractive for economic activities including transport,
              industries, tourism and development of infrastructure. Logging is not a major threat; the use of the
              road
              network established for the transport of logs from forests increases anthropogenic pressures in
              unprotected
              leopard habitat.</p>

            <p class="description">The Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli) is a subspecies of the western
              gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). It was named a new species in 1904 by Paul Matschie, a mammalian taxonomist
              working
              at the Humboldt University Zoological Museum in Berlin, but its populations were not systematically
              surveyed
              until 1987.
              It is the most western and northern form of gorilla, and is restricted to the forested hills and
              mountains of
              the Cameroon-Nigeria border region at the headwaters of the Cross River (Nigeria). It is separated by
              about
              300 km (190 mi) from the nearest population of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and
              by around
              250 km (160 mi) from the gorilla population in the Ebo Forest of Cameroon. Estimates from 2014 suggest
              that
              fewer than 250 mature Cross River gorillas remain, making them the world's rarest great
              ape.[1][4] Groups of
              these gorillas concentrate their activities in 11 localities across a 12,000 km2 (4,600 sq mi) range,
              though
              recent field surveys confirmed the presence of gorillas outside of their known localities suggesting a
              wider
              distribution within this range. This distribution is supported by genetic research, which has found
              evidence
              that many Cross River gorilla localities continue to maintain contact through the occasional dispersal
              of
              individuals. In 2009, the Cross River gorilla was finally captured on professional video on a forested
              mountain
              in Cameroon.</p>

              with
              long and dense hair. The length of hair on the back is 20–25 mm (0.79–0.98 in) in summer and up to 70 mm
              (2.8 in) in winter. The winter coat varies from fairly light yellow to dense yellowish-red with a golden
              tinge
              or rusty-reddish-yellow. In summer, the fur is brighter with more vivid coloration pattern. It is rather
              small

            <h2 class="habitat">Habitat:</h2>
            <p class="description">The Cross River gorilla, like many other gorilla subspecies, prefer a dense forest
              habitat
              that is uninhabited by humans. Due to the Cross River gorilla’s body size they require large and diverse
              areas
              of the forest to meet their habitat requirements. Similar to most endangered primates, their natural
              habitat
              exists where humans are often occupying and using for natural resources. Forests that are inhabited by
              the Cross
              River gorilla vary in altitude from approximately 100 to 2,037 metres (328 to 6,683 ft) above sea level.
              Between
              1996 and 1999, Field work was conducted on Afi Mountain in Cross River State, Nigeria for a period of 32
              months.
              A great deal of data were collected, and things such as habitat types and topography mapped using line
              transects, climate, spatial and temporal availability of tree and herb foods and also the Cross River
              gorilla's
              wide range behavior, diet, and its grouping patterns. These data were all assessed from indirect
              evidence, such
              as feeding trails, nests, and feces.
              The habitats of the Cross River gorilla are negatively affected by the drastic deforestation and
              fragmentation
              of the land. These unfortunate events leave the gorilla species with few options for survival. As a
              result of
              deforestation and fragmentation, there are drastic reductions in carrying capacity, in other words, the
              size of
              the territories these animals inhabit has been significantly reduced. Because the population of humans
              living in
              this area is high, the amount of resources available to the Cross River gorillas is limited. Even though
              this
              decrease in the availability of land may appear to be a problem, research studies have found that an
              adequate
              amount of rainforest still remains that is suitable and comfortable for this subspecies. If, however,
              human
              pressures and activities towards deforestation continue, these territories will continue to diminish and
              ultimately will not exist. Additional examples of human activity that threaten Cross River gorillas and,
              of
              course, other species, are hunting, logging, agriculture, fuel wood harvesting, clearance of lands for
              plantation and exploitation of natural resources. Gorillas and other primates are only a small part of
              the
              larger ecosystem and thus, they rely on many aspects of their habitat for survival. Furthermore, also
              because of
              their body size, they lack ability to adapt to new environment and they have a rather slow reproductive
              rate.
              Even though there is somewhat of a limited research on Cross River gorillas, there is enough to conclude
              that
              these animals are currently able to sustain survival. What is still under debate is the total number of
              Cross
              River gorillas that exist.
              The Cross River gorilla is not only a critically endangered sub-species, as labeled by the IUCN,
              International
              Union for Conservation of Nature, but is under studied. The limited territories of their natural
              wildlife has
              led to that Cross River gorillas are approximately 200 kilometres (120 mi) away from other gorilla
              populations.
              This region is around the Nigeria-Cameroon border in which there are highland areas creating geographic
              restrictions for these gorillas. Most of the habit regions for Cross River gorillas are legally
              protected due to
              their critically endangered status. However, there are still areas that are not like between the Kagwene
              Mountain and Upper Mbulu, and around Mone North. </p>

            <p class="description">The <b>hawksbill sea turtle </b>(Eretmochelys imbricata) is a Critically
              Endangered sea turtle belonging to the family Cheloniidae. It is the only extant species in
              the genus Eretmochelys. The species has a worldwide distribution,
              with Atlantic and Indo-Pacific subspecies—E. i. imbricata and E. i. bissa, respectively.
              The hawksbill's appearance is similar to that of other marine turtles. In general, it has a flattened
              body shape, a protective carapace, and flipper-like limbs, adapted for swimming in the open ocean. E.
              imbricata is easily distinguished from other sea turtles by its sharp, curving beak with
              prominent tomium, and the saw-like appearance of its shell margins. Hawksbill shells slightly change
              colors, depending on water temperature. While this turtle lives part of its life in the open ocean, it
              spends more time in shallow lagoons and coral reefs. The World Conservation Union, primarily as a result
              of Human fishing practices, classifies E. imbricata as critically endangered. Hawksbill shells were the
              primary source of tortoiseshell material used for decorative purposes. The Convention on International
              Trade in Endangered Species outlaws the capture and trade of hawksbill sea turtles and products derived
              from them.

            <!--row 3-->
            <h2 class="characteristics">Anatomy and morphology:</h2>
            <p class="description">Adult hawksbill sea turtles typically grow to 1 m (3 ft) in length, weighing around
              80 kg (180 lb) on average. The heaviest hawksbill ever captured weighed 127 kg (280 lb). The turtle's
              shell, or carapace, has an amber background patterned with an irregular combination of light and dark
              streaks, with predominantly black and mottled-brown colors radiating to the sides.
              Several characteristics of the hawksbill sea turtle distinguish it from other sea turtle species. Its
              elongated, tapered head ends in a beak-like mouth (from which its common name is derived), and its beak
              is more sharply pronounced and hooked than others. The hawksbill's forelimbs have two visible claws on
              each flipper. One of the hawksbill's more easily distinguished characteristics is the pattern of
              thick scutes that make up its carapace. While its carapace has five central scutes and four pairs
              of lateral scutes like several members of its family, E. imbricata's posterior scutes overlap in such a
              way as to give the rear margin of its carapace a serrated look, similar to the edge of a saw or a steak
              knife. The turtle's carapace has been known to reach almost 1 m (3 ft) in length.[6] The hawksbill
              appears to frequently employ its sturdy shell to insert its body into tight spaces in reefs.
              Crawling with an alternating gait, hawksbill tracks left in the sand are asymmetrical. In contrast,
              the green sea turtle and the leatherback turtle have a more symmetrical gait.
              Due to its consumption of venomous cnidarians, hawksbill sea turtle flesh can become toxic.[10]
              The hawksbill sea turtle has been shown to be biofluorescent and is the first reptile recorded with this
              characteristic. It is unknown if this is derived from the turtle's diet, which includes biofluorescent
              organisms like the hard coral Physogyra lichtensteini. Males have more intense pigmentation than
              females, and a behavioural role of these differences is speculated.

            <h2 class="threats">Life history:</h2>
            <p class="description">Not much is known about the life history of hawksbills. Their life history can be
              divided into three phases, namely the pelagic phase, from hatching to about 20 cm, the benthic phase,
              when the immature turtles recruit to foraging areas, and the reproductive phase, when they reach sexual
              maturity. The pelagic phase possibly lasts until the turtles reach around 20 cm in length in 1–3
              years, reaching sexual maturity at around 40 cm (2–4 years). Hawksbills show a degree of fidelity after
              recruiting to the benthic phase, however movement to other similar habitats is possible.
            </p>
            <h6>Breeding</h6>
            <p>Hawksbills mate biannually in secluded lagoons off their nesting beaches in remote islands throughout
              their range. The most significant nesting beaches are in Mexico, the Seychelles, Indonesia, and
              Australia. Mating season for Atlantic hawksbills usually spans April to November. Indian Ocean
              populations, such as the Seychelles hawksbill population, mate from September to February. After mating,
              females drag their heavy bodies high onto the beach during the night. They clear an area of debris and
              dig a nesting hole using their rear flippers, then lay clutches of eggs and cover them with
              sand. Caribbean and Florida nests of E. imbricata normally contain around 140 eggs. After the hours-long
              process, the female returns to the sea. Their nests can be found throughout beaches in about 60
              countries.
              The baby turtles, usually weighing less than 24 g (0.85 oz) hatch at night after around two months.
              These newly emergent hatchlings are dark-colored, with heart-shaped carapaces measuring around 2.5 cm
              (0.98 in) long. They instinctively crawl into the sea, attracted by the reflection of the moon on the
              water (possibly disrupted by light sources such as street lamps and lights). While they emerge under the
              cover of darkness, baby turtles that do not reach the water by daybreak are preyed upon
              by shorebirds, shore crabs, and other predators.
            </p>
            <h6>Maturity</h6>
            <p> Hawksbills evidently reach maturity after 20 years. Their lifespan is unknown. Like other sea turtles,
              hawksbills are solitary for most of their lives; they meet only to mate. They are
              highly migratory. Because of their tough carapaces, adults' only predators are sharks, estuarine
              crocodiles, octopuses, and some species of pelagic fish.
              A series of biotic and abiotic cues, such as individual genetics, foraging quantity and quality,or
              population density, may trigger the maturation of the reproductive organs and the production of gametes
              and thus determine sexual maturity. Like many reptiles, all marine turtles of a same aggregation are
              highly unlikely to reach sexual maturity at the same size and thus age. Age at maturity has been
              estimated to occur between 10 and 25 years of age for Caribbean hawksbills. Turtles nesting in the
              Indo-Pacific region may reach maturity at a minimum of 30 to 35 years.</p>

            <h2 class="characteristics">Behaviour and ecology:</h2>
            <p class="description">Compared with the Bornean orangutan, the Sumatran orangutan tends to be
              more frugivorous and especially insectivorous. Preferred fruits include figs and jackfruits. It will
              also eat bird eggs and small vertebrates. Sumatran orangutans spend far less time feeding on the inner
              bark of trees.
              Wild Sumatran orangutans in the Suaq Balimbing swamp have been observed using tools. An orangutan will
              break off a tree branch that is about a foot long, snap off the twigs and fray one end with its
              teeth. The orangutan will use the stick to dig in tree holes for termites. They will also use the stick
              to poke a bee's nest wall, move it around and catch the honey. In addition, orangutans use tools to eat
              fruit. When the fruit of the Neesia tree ripens, its hard, ridged husk softens until it falls open.
              Inside are seeds that the orangutans enjoy eating, but they are surrounded by fiberglass-like hairs that
              are painful if eaten. Tools are created differently for different uses. Sticks are often made longer or
              shorter depending on whether they will be used for insects or fruits. If a particular tool proves
              useful, the orangutan will often save it. Over time, they will collect entire
              "toolboxes". A Neesia-eating orangutan will select a five-inch stick, strip off its bark, and then
              carefully collect the hairs with it. Once the fruit is safe, the ape will eat the seeds using the stick
              or its fingers. Although similar swamps can be found in Borneo, wild Bornean orangutans have not been
              seen using these types of tools.NHNZ filmed the Sumatran orangutan for its show Wild Asia: In the Realm
              of the Red Ape; it showed one of them using a simple tool, a twig, to pry food from difficult places.
              There is also a sequence of an animal using a large leaf as an umbrella in a tropical rainstorm.
              As well as being used as tools, tree branches are a means of transportation for the Sumatran orangutan.
              The orangutans are the heaviest mammals to travel by tree, which makes them particularly susceptible to
              the changes in arboreal compliance. To deal with this, their locomotion is characterized by slow
              movement, long contact times, and an impressively large array of locomotors postures. Orangutans have
              even been shown to utilize the compliance in vertical supports to lower the cost of locomotion by
              swaying trees back and forth and they possess unique strategies of locomotion, moving slowly and using
              multiple supports to limit oscillations in compliant branches, particularly at their tips.
              The Sumatran orangutan is also more arboreal than its Bornean cousin; this could be because of the
              presence of large predators, like the Sumatran tiger. It moves through the trees by quadrumanous
              locomotion and semibrachiation.
              As of 2015, the Sumatran orangutans species only has approximately 7,000 remaining members in its
              population. The World Wide Fund for Nature is thus carrying out attempts to protect the species by
              allowing them to reproduce in the safe environment of captivity. However, this comes at a risk to the
              Sumatran orangutan’s native behaviors in the wild. While in captivity, the orangutans are at risk to the
              "Captivity Effect": animals held in captivity for a prolonged period will no longer know how to behave
              naturally in the wild. Being provided with water, food, and shelter while in captivity and lacking all
              the challenges of living in the wild, captive behaviour becomes more exploratory in nature.
              A repertoire of 64 different gestures in use by orangutans has been identified, 29 of which are thought
              to have a specific meaning that can be interpreted by other orangutans the majority of the time. Six
              intentional meanings were identified: Affiliate/Play, Stop action, Look at/Take object, Share
              food/object, Co-locomote and Move away. Sumatran orangutans do not use sounds as part of their
              communication, which includes a lack of audible danger signals, but rather base their communication on
              gestures alone. </p>

              when the immature turtles recruit to foraging areas, and the reproductive phase, when they reach sexual
              maturity. The pelagic phase possibly lasts until the turtles reach around 20 cm in length in 1–3
              years, reaching sexual maturity at around 40 cm (2–4 years). Hawksbills show a degree of fidelity after
              recruiting to the benthic phase, however movement to other similar habitats is possible.
            </p>
            <h6>Breeding</h6>
            <p>Hawksbills mate biannually in secluded lagoons off their nesting beaches in remote islands throughout
              their range. The most significant nesting beaches are in Mexico, the Seychelles, Indonesia, and
              Australia. Mating season for Atlantic hawksbills usually spans April to November. Indian Ocean
              populations, such as the Seychelles hawksbill population, mate from September to February. After mating,
              females drag their heavy bodies high onto the beach during the night. They clear an area of debris and
              dig a nesting hole using their rear flippers, then lay clutches of eggs and cover them with
              sand. Caribbean and Florida nests of E. imbricata normally contain around 140 eggs. After the hours-long
              process, the female returns to the sea. Their nests can be found throughout beaches in about 60
              countries.
              The baby turtles, usually weighing less than 24 g (0.85 oz) hatch at night after around two months.
              These newly emergent hatchlings are dark-colored, with heart-shaped carapaces measuring around 2.5 cm
              (0.98 in) long. They instinctively crawl into the sea, attracted by the reflection of the moon on the
              water (possibly disrupted by light sources such as street lamps and lights). While they emerge under the
              cover of darkness, baby turtles that do not reach the water by daybreak are preyed upon
              by shorebirds, shore crabs, and other predators.
            </p>
            <h6>Life cycle:</h6>
            <p> The Sumatran orangutan has five stages of life that are characterized by different physical and
              behavioral features. The first of these stages is infancy, which lasts from birth to around 2.5
              years-old. The orangutan weighs between 2 and 6 kilograms. An infant is identified by light pigmented
              zones around the eyes and muzzle in contrast to darker pigmentation on the rest of the face as well as
              long hairs that protrude outward around the face. During this time, the infant is always carried by the
              mother during travel, she/he is highly dependent on the mother for food, and also sleeps in the mother's
              nest. The next stage is called juvenile-hood and takes place between 2.5 and 5 years-old. The orangutan
              weighs between 6 and 15 kilograms and does not look dramatically different from an infant. Although s/he
              is still mainly carried by the mother, a juvenile will often play with peers and make small exploratory
              trips within the vision of the mother. Towards the end of this stage, the orangutan will stop sleeping
              in the mother's nest and will build its own nest nearby. From the ages of 5 to 8 years-old, the
              orangutan is in an adolescent stage of life. S/he weighs around 15-30 kilograms. The light patches on
              the face start to disappear and eventually the face becomes completely dark. During this time,
              orangutans still have constant contact with their mothers, yet they develop a stronger relationship with
              peers while playing in groups. They are still young and act with caution around unfamiliar adults,
              especially males. At 8 years-old, female orangutans are considered fully developed and begin to have
              offspring of their own. Males, however, enter a stage called sub-adulthood. This stage lasts from 8 to
              around 13 or 15 years-old and the orangutans weigh around 30 to 50 kilograms. Their faces are completely
              dark and they begin to develop cheek flanges. Their beard starts to emerge while the hair around their
              face shortens and instead of pointing outwards it flattens along the skull. This stage marks sexual
              maturity in males, yet these orangutans are still socially undeveloped and will still avoid contact with
              adult males. Finally, male Sumatrans orangutans reach adulthood at 13 to 15 years of age. They are
              extremely large animals, weighing between 50 and 90 kilograms, roughly the weight of a fully grown
              human. They have a fully grown beard, fully developed cheek callosities, and long hair. These orangutans
              have reached full sexual and social maturity and now only travel alone.
              Female Sumatran orangutans typically live 44 - 53 years in the wild while males have a slightly longer
              lifespan of 47 - 58 years. Females are able to give birth up to 53 years of age, based on studies of
              menopausal cycles. Both males and females are usually considered healthy even at the end of their
              lifespans and can be identified as such by the regular abundance of hair growth and robust cheek
              pads. The Sumatran orangutan is more social than its Bornean counterpart; groups gather to feed on the
              mass amounts of fruit on fig trees. The Sumatran orangutan community is best described as loose, not
              showing social or spatial exclusivity. Groups generally consist of female clusters and a preferred male
              mate. However, adult males generally avoid contact with other adult males. Subadult males will try to
              mate with any female, although mostly unsuccessfully, since mature females are easily capable of fending
              them off. Mature females prefer to mate with mature males. Usually, there is a specific male in a group
              that mature females will exhibit preference for.[13] Male Sumatran orangutans sometimes have a delay of
              many years in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as cheek flanges and muscle
              mass.
              Males exhibit bimaturism, whereby fully flanged adult males and the smaller unflanged males are both
              capable of reproducing, but employ differing mating strategies to do so.
              The average interbirth rates for the Sumatran orangutan is 9.3 years, the longest reported among
              the great apes, including the Bornean orangutan. Infant orangutans will stay close to their mothers for
              up to three years. Even after that, the young will still associate with their mothers. Both the Sumatran
              and Bornean orangutans are likely to live several decades; estimated longevity is more than 50 years.
              The average of the first reproduction of P. abeliiis around 15.4 years old. There is no indication
              of menopause.
              Nonja, thought to be the world's oldest orangutan in captivity or the wild at the time of her death,
              died at the Miami MetroZoo at the age of 55.
              As of 2019, the world's oldest orangutan in captivity or the wild is Inji, who celebrated her 59th
              birthday at the Oregon Zoo on January 30th.

            <p class="description"><b>Sumatran elephant</b> (Elephas maximus sumatranus) is one of three
              recognized subspecies of the Asian elephant, and native to the Indonesia island of Sumatra. In 2011, the
              Sumatran elephant has been classified as critically endangered by IUCN as the population has declined by
              at least 80% over the last three generations, estimated to be about 75 years. The subspecies is
              pre-eminently threatened by habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, and poaching; over 69% of
              potential elephant habitat has been lost within the last 25 years. Much of the remaining forest cover is
              in blocks smaller than 250 km2 (97 sq mi), which are too small to contain viable elephant populations.

            <p class="description">In general, Asian elephants are smaller than African elephants and have the highest
              body point on the head. The tip of their trunk has one finger-like process. Their back is convex or
              level. Females are usually smaller than males, and have short or no tusks.
              Sumatran elephants reach a shoulder height of between 2 and 3.2 m (6.6 and 10.5 ft), weigh between 2,000
              and 4,000 kg (4,400 and 8,800 lb), and have 20 pairs of ribs. Their skin colour is lighter than

            <h2 class="threats">Threats:</h2>
            <p class="description">Due to conversion of forests into human settlements and agricultural areas, many of
              the Sumatran elephant populations have lost their habitat to humans. As a result, many elephants have
              been removed from the wild or directly killed. In addition to conflict related death, elephants are also
              targets of poaching for their ivory. Between 1985 and 2007, 50% of Sumatran elephants died. Between 1980
              and 2005, 69% of potential Sumatran elephant habitat was lost within just one elephant generation, and
              the driving forces that caused this habitat loss still remain essentially unchecked. There is clear,
              direct evidence from two provinces, Riau and Lampung, which shows entire elephant populations have
              disappeared as a result of habitat loss.
              Most of the elephants found in Sumatran camps were captured after crop-raiding in protected areas. The
              reduction of the elephants' habitat for illegal conversion of agriculture still continues.
              Between 2012 and 2015, 36 elephants were found dead in Aceh Province due to poisoning, electrocution and
              traps. Most dead elephants were found near palm oil plantations. Conservationists think that Sumatran
              elephants may become extinct in less than ten years if poaching is not stopped.
            </p>
            <h2>Distribution of populations:</h2>
            <p>The Sumatran elephant was once widespread on the island, and Riau Province was believed to have the
              largest elephant population in Sumatra with over 1,600 individuals in the 1980s. In 1985, an island-wide
              rapid survey suggested that between 2,800 and 4,800 elephants lived in all eight mainland provinces of
              Sumatra in 44 populations. Twelve of these populations occurred in Lampung Province, where only three
              populations were extant in 2002 according to surveys carried out between September 2000 and March 2002.
              The population in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park was estimated at 498 individuals, while the
              population in Way Kambas National Park was estimated at 180 individuals. The third population in Gunung
              Rindingan–Way Waya complex was considered to be too small to be viable over the long-term.
              By 2008, elephants had become locally extinct in 23 of the 43 ranges identified in Sumatra in 1985,
              indicating a very significant decline of the Sumatran elephant population up to that time. By 2008, the
              elephant was locally extinct in West Sumatra Province and at risk of being lost from North Sumatra
              Province too. In Riau Province only about 350 elephants survived across nine separate ranges.
              The current Sumatran elephant population is estimated at 2,400–2,800 wild individuals, excluding
              elephants in camps, in 25 fragmented populations across the island. More than 85% of their habitat is
              outside of protected areas.</p>
            <h2>Ecology and behaviour:</h2>
            <p>Female elephants stop reproducing after 60 years of age. The maximum longevity in the wild is around 60
              years. Female captive elephants have survived until 75 years while males have survived 60 years.
              Birth happens at night and lasts approximately 10 seconds. The infant is able to stand up on its own
              after 10 to 30 minutes.
            </p>
            <h2>Conservation:</h2>
            <p>Elephas maximus is listed on CITES Appendix I. Sumatran elephants are protected under Indonesia law.
              In 2004, the Tesso Nilo National Park has been established in Riau Province to protect the Sumatran
              elephant's habitat. This forest is one of the last areas large enough to support a viable population of
              elephants.
              Between 1986 and 1995, 520 wild elephants were captured and kept in six Elephant Training Centres, which
              have been established since 1986 in the provinces of Lampung, Aceh, Bengkulu, North and South Sumatra,
              and Riau. Capturing wild elephants was stopped in 1999, since the maintenance of captive elephants was
              too expensive, their management had not become self-financing and because some of the centres were
              overcrowded. By the end of 2000, 391 elephants were kept in the centres, and a few more in zoos, safari
              parks and tourist areas.

            <h2 class="characteristics">Etymology:</h2>
            <p class="description">The name saola has been translated as "spindle[-horned]", although the precise
              meaning is actually "spinning-wheel post horn". The name comes from a Tai language of Vietnam, but the
              meaning is the same in the Lao language (ເສົາຫລາ, also spelled ເສົາຫຼາ /sǎo-lǎː/ in Lao). The specific
              name nghetinhensis refers to the two Vietnamese provinces of Nghệ An and Hà Tĩnh,
              while Pseudoryx acknowledges the animal's similarities with the Arabian or African oryx. Hmong people in
              Laos refer to the animal as saht-supahp, a term derived from Lao (ສັດສຸພາບ /sàt supʰáːp/) meaning "the
              polite animal", because it moves quietly through the forest. Other names used by minority groups in the
              Saola's range are lagiang (Van Kieu), a ngao (Ta Oi) and xoong xor (Katu).  In the press, saolas have
              been referred to as "Asian unicorns",an appellation apparently due to the saola's rarity and reported
              gentle nature, and perhaps because both the saola and the oryx have been linked with the unicorn. No
              known link exists with the Western unicorn myth or the "Chinese unicorn", the qilin.</p>

            <h2 class="threats">Discovery:</h2>
            <p class="description">In May 1992, the Ministry of Forestry, Vietnam sent a survey team to examine the
              biodiversity of the newly established Vu Quang National Park. On this team were Do Tuoc, Le Van Cham and
              Vu Van Dung (of the Forest Inventory and Planning Institute); Nguyen Van Sang (of the Institute of
              Ecological and Biological Resources); Nguyen Thai Tu (of Vinh University); and John MacKinnon (of
              the World Wildlife Fund). On 21 May, the team procured a skull featuring a pair of strange, long and
              pointed horns from a local hunter. They came across a similar pair in the Annamite Range in the
              northeastern region of the reserve the following day. The team ascribed these features to a
              new bovid species, calling it the "saola" or the "Vu Quang ox" to avoid confusion with
              the sympatric serow. The WWF officially announced the discovery of the new species on 17 July 1992.
              According to biodiversity specialist Tony Whitten, though Vietnam boasts a variety of flora and fauna,
              many of which have been recently described, the discovery of as large an animal as the saola was quite
              unexpected. The saola was the first large mammal to be discovered in the area for 50 years. Observations
              of live saola have been few and far between, restricted to the Annamite Range.
            </p>
            <h2>Taxonomy and evolution:</h2>
            <p>The scientific name of the saola is Pseudoryx nghetinhensis. It is the sole member of
              the genus Pseudoryx and is classified under the family Bovidae. The species was first described in 1993
              by Vu Van Dung, Do Tuoc, biologists Pham Mong Giao and Nguyen Ngoc Chinh, Peter Arctander of
              the University of Copenhagen and John MacKinnon. The discovery of saola remains in 1992 generated huge
              scientific interest due to the animal's special physical traits. The saola differs significantly from
              all other bovid genera in appearance and morphology, enough to place it in its own genus (Pseudoryx).
              A recent sequencing study of ribosomal mitochondrial DNA of a large taxon sample divides the bovid
              family into two major subfamilial clades. The first clade is the subfamily Bovinae consisting of three
              tribes: Bovini (cattle and buffaloes), Tragelaphini (Strepsicerotini) (African spiral-horned bovids) and
              "Bosalaphini". The second clade is the subfamily Antelopinae, which includes all other bovids.
              Antelopinae is composed of the three tribes: Caprini(goats, sheep, and muskox), Hippotragini (horse-like
              antelopes), and Antilopini (gazelles).
              Since its physical traits are so complex to classify, Pseudoryx had been classified variously as member
              of the subfamily Caprinae and as belonging to any of the three tribes of the subfamily Bovinae:
              Boselaphini, Bovini and Tragelaphini. DNA analysis has led scientists to place the saola as a member of
              the tribe Bovini. The morphology of its horns, teeth and some other features indicate it should be
              grouped with less-derived or more ancestral bovids. Scientific consensus may lead to classifying the
              saola as the sole member of a proposed new tribe Pseudorygini.
            </p>
            <h2>Ecology and behaviour:</h2>
            <p>Local people reported that the saola is active in the day as well as at night, but prefers resting during
              the hot midday hours. Robichaud noted that the captive female was active mainly during the day, but
              pointed out that the observation could have been influenced by the unfamiliar surroundings the animal
              found herself in. When she rested, she would draw her forelegs inward to her belly, extend her neck so
              that her chin touched the ground, and close her eyes. Though apparently solitary, saola have been
              reported in groups of two or threeas well as up to six or seven. Grouping patterns of the saola resemble
              those of the bushbuck, anoa, and sitatunga.
              Robichaud observed that the captive female was calm in the presence of humans, but was afraid of dogs.
              On an encounter with a dog, she would resort to snorting and thrust her head forward, pointing her horns
              at her opponent. Her erect ears pointed backward, and she stood stiffly with her back arched. Meanwhile,
              she hardly paid any attention to her surroundings. This female was found to urinate and defecate
              separately, dropping her hind legs and lowering her lower body – a common observation among bovids. She
              would spend considerable time grooming herself with her strong tongue. Marking behaviour in the female
              involved opening up the flap of the maxillary gland and leaving a pungent secretion on rocks and
              vegetation. She would give out short bleats occasionally.
            </p>
            <h2>Conservation:</h2>
            <p>The saola is currently considered to be critically endangered. Its restrictive habitat requirements and
              aversion to human proximity are likely to endanger it through habitat loss and habitat fragmentation.
              Saola suffer losses through local hunting and the illegal trade in furs, traditional medicines, and for
              use of the meat in restaurants and food markets. They also sometimes get caught in snares that have been
              set to catch animals raiding crops, such as wild boar, sambar, and muntjac. More than 26,651 snares have
              so far been removed from Saola habitats by conservation groups.
              The key feature of the area occupied by the saola is its remoteness from human disturbance.[21] Saola
              are shot for their meat, but hunters also gain high esteem in the village for the production of a
              carcass. Due to the scarcity, the locals place much more value on the saola than more common species.
              Because the people in this area are traditional hunters, their attitude about killing the saola is hard
              to change; this makes conservation difficult. The intense interest from the scientific community has
              actually motivated hunters to capture live specimens. Commercial logging has been stopped in the nature
              reserve area of Bu Huong, and there is an official ban on forest clearance within the boundaries of the
              reserve.
              Species of conservation concern are frequently hard to study; there are often delays in implementing or
              identifying necessary conservation needs due to lack of data. Because the species is so rare, there is a
              continuous lack of adequate data; this is one of the major problems facing saola conservation. Trained
              scientists have never observed saola in the wild. Unfortunately, because it is unlikely that intact
              saola populations exist, field surveys to discover these populations are not a conservation priority.
              The Saola Working Group was formed by the IUCN Species Survival Commission's Asian Wild Cattle
              Specialist Group, in 2006 to protect the saolas and their habitat. This coalition includes about 40
              experts from the forestry departments of Laos and Vietnam, Vietnam's Institute of Ecology and Biological
              Resources, Vinh University, biologists and conservationists from Wildlife Conservation Society, and the
              World Wide Fund for Nature.
              A group of scientists from the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology in central Hanoi, within the
              Institute of Biotechnology, investigated a last resort effort of conserving the species by cloning, an
              extremely difficult approach even in the case of well-understood species. However, the lack of female
              saola donors (of enucleated ovocytes), receptive females, as well as the interspecific barriers, greatly
              compromise the success of cloning technique.

            <p class="description">The <b>vaquita</b> (Spanish: [baˈkita]; Phocoena sinus) is
              a species of porpoise endemic to
              the northern part of the Gulf of California that is on the brink of extinction. Based on beached skulls
              found in
              1950 and 1951, the scientific description of the species was published in 1958.[3] The word vaquita is
              Spanish
              for "little cow". Other names include cochito (Spanish for "little pig"), desert porpoise, vaquita
              porpoise, Gulf of California harbor porpoise, Gulf of California porpoise, and gulf porpoise. Since
              the baiji (Yangtze River dolphin, Lipotes vexillifer) is thought to have gone extinct in 2006,[4] the
              vaquita
              has taken on the title of the most endangered cetacean in the world.[5] It has been listed as critically
              endangered since 1996. The population was estimated at 600 in 1997, below 100 in 2014, approximately 60 in
              2015, around 30 in November 2016, and only 12-15 in March 2018, leading to the conclusion that the species
              will
              soon be extinct unless drastic action is taken. An estimate released in March 2019, based on acoustic data
              gathered in the summer of 2018, is that a maximum of 22 and a minimum of 6 vaquita porpoises remain, with
              the
              IUCN supporting roughly about 10 individuals. A further estimate released in July 2019 concluded that the
              population size in autumn 2018 was about 9.
              The population decrease is largely attributed to bycatch from the illegal gillnet fishery for the totoaba,
              a
              similarly sized endemic drum that is also critically endangered. The population decline has occurred
              despite an
              investment of tens of millions of dollars by the Mexican government in efforts to eliminate the bycatch. A
              partial gillnet ban was put in place for two years in May 2015; its scheduled expiration at the end of May
              2017
              spurred a campaign to have it extended and strengthened. On 7 June 2017, an agreement was announced by
              Mexican
              president Enrique Peña Nieto to make the gillnet ban permanent and strengthen enforcement. As well as the
              Mexican government and various environmental organizations, this effort will now also involve the
              foundations of
              Mexican businessman Carlos Slim and American actor and environmental activist Leonardo DiCaprio. However,
              the
              July 2019 report indicated that the gillnet ban had had no effect on the ongoing rate of decline of about
              50%
              per year.
              A protective housing/captive breeding program, unprecedented for a marine mammal, has been developed and
              is
              undergoing feasibility testing, being now viewed as necessary to rescue the species. However, the sea pen
              housing needed to implement this strategy is not expected to be available until October 2017,which is
              feared may
              be too late. Additionally, the ability of the vaquita to survive and reproduce while confined to a
              sanctuary is
              uncertain. The Mexican government approved the plan on 3 April 2017, with commencement projected to begin
              in
              October 2017. In November 2017, the attempt to capture wild vaquitas for captive breeding and safekeeping
              was
              suspended following the death of a female vaquita. The adult female died within hours of being
              captured. In
              December 2017, Mexico, the United States and China agreed to take further steps to prevent trade in
              totoaba
              bladders. Despite its extremely low population, reports indicate the small number of surviving vaquita are
              still
              relatively healthy and able to breed. However, the intensifying poaching and the extremely low population
              make
              it likely that the species will go extinct unless drastic measures are taken. If the species does go
              extinct, it
              will likely be the first cetacean to do so since the baiji.</p>

            <h2 class="characteristics">Description:</h2>
            <p class="description">Vaquitas are the smallest and most endangered species of the infraorder Cetacea and
              are
              endemic to the northern end of the Gulf of California. The vaquita is somewhat stocky and has a
              characteristic
              porpoise shape. The species is distinguishable by the dark rings surrounding their eyes, patches on their
              lips,
              and a line that extends from their dorsal fins to their mouths. Their backs are a dark grey that fades to
              white
              undersides. As vaquitas mature, the shades of grey lighten. Female vaquitas tend to grow larger than
              males. On
              average, females mature to a length of 140.6 cm (55.4 in), compared to 134.9 cm (53.1 in) for males. The
              lifespan, pattern of growth, seasonal reproduction, and testes size of the vaquita are all similar to that
              of
              the harbour porpoise. The flippers are proportionately larger than those of other porpoises, and the fin
              is
              taller and more falcated. The skull is smaller and the rostrum is shorter and broader than in other
              members of
              the genus.</p>

            <h2 class="threats">Taxonomy:</h2>
            <p class="description">The porpoise genus Phocoena comprises four species, all of which inhabit coastal
              waters,
              two each in the northern and southern hemispheres. Vaquitas are believed on the basis of morphological and
              genetic evidence to be most closely related to Burmeister's porpoise (P. spinipinnis) of South America.
              Their
              ancestors are thought to have crossed the equator during a cooler period of the Pleistocene.</p>

            <h2>Behavior:</h2>
            <p>Vaquitas use high-pitched sounds to communicate with one another and for echolocation to navigate through
              their
              habitats. They generally feed and swim at a leisurely pace. Vaquitas avoid boats and are very evasive.
              They rise
              to breathe with a slow, forward motion and then disappear quickly. This lack of activity at the surface
              makes
              them difficult to observe. Vaquitas are usually alone unless they are accompanied by a calf, meaning they
              are
              less social than other porpoise species. They may also be more competitive during mating season. They are
              the
              only species belonging to the porpoise family that live in warm waters. Vaquitas are non-selective
              predators.
            </p>
            <h6>Schooling</h6>
            <p> Like other Phocoena, vaquitas are usually seen singly. If they are seen together, it is usually in small
              groups of two or three individuals. Less often, groups around ten have been observed, with the most ever
              seen at
              once being 40 individuals.
            </p>
            <h6>Diet</h6>
            <p>Vaquitas tend to forage near lagoons. All of the 17 fish species found in vaquita stomachs can be
              classified
              as demersal and or benthic species inhabiting relatively shallow water in the upper Gulf of California.
              Vaquitas
              appear to be rather non-selective feeders on crustaceans, small fish, octopuses and squid in this
              area. Some of
              the most common prey are teleosts (fish with bony skeletons) such as grunts, croakers, and sea trout. Like
              other cetaceans, vaquitas may use echolocation to locate prey, particularly as their habitat is often
              turbid</p>

            <p class="description">The <b>Javan rhinoceros</b> (Rhinoceros sondaicus), also known as the Sunda
              rhinoceros or lesser one-horned rhinoceros, is a very rare member of the family Rhinocerotidae and one
              of five extant rhinoceroses. It belongs to the same genus as the Indian rhinoceros, and has similar
              mosaic, armour-like skin, but at 3.1–3.2 m (10–10 ft) in length and 1.4–1.7 m (4.6–5.6 ft) in height, it
              is smaller (closer in size to the black rhinoceros of the genus Diceros). Its horn is usually shorter
              than 25 cm (9.8 in), and is smaller than those of the other rhino species. Only adult males have horns;
              females lack them altogether.
              Once the most widespread of Asian rhinoceroses, the Javan rhinoceros ranged from the islands
              of Java and Sumatra, throughout Southeast Asia, and into India and China. The species is critically
              endangered, with only one known population in the wild, and no individuals in captivity. It is possibly
              the rarest large mammal on Earth, with a population of as few as 58 to 61 in Ujung Kulon National
              Park at the western tip of Java in Indonesia. A second population in Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam
              was declared by some conservation groups to be extinct in 2011. The decline of the Javan rhinoceros is
              attributed to poaching, primarily for their horns, which are highly valued in traditional Chinese
              medicine, fetching as much as US$30,000 per kg on the black market. As European presence in their range
              increased, trophy hunting also became a serious threat. Loss of habitat, especially as the result of
              wars, such as the Vietnam War, in Southeast Asia, has also contributed to the species' decline and
              hindered recovery. The remaining range is within one nationally protected area, but the rhinos are still
              at risk from poachers, disease, and loss of genetic diversity leading to inbreeding depression.
              The Javan rhino can live around 30–45 years in the wild. It historically inhabited lowland rain forest,
              wet grasslands, and large floodplains. It is mostly solitary, except for courtship and
              offspring-rearing, though groups may occasionally congregate near wallows and salt licks. Aside from
              humans, adults have no predators in their range. The Javan rhino usually avoids humans. Scientists and
              conservationists rarely study the animals directly due to their extreme rarity and the danger of
              interfering with such an endangered species. Researchers rely on camera traps and fecal samples to gauge
              health and behavior. Consequently, the Javan rhino is the least studied of all rhino species. Two adult
              rhinos with their calves were filmed in a motion-triggered video released on 28 February 2011 by WWF and
              Indonesia's National Park Authority, which proved it is still breeding in the wild. In April 2012, the
              National Parks Authority released video showing 35 individual Javan rhinos, including mother/offspring
              pairs and courting adults. There are only 58 to 68 individuals left in the wild, and none in captivity,
              after the death of a male rhinoceros named Samson. Samson died in April 2018 at 30 years of age, far
              younger than the species' usual lifespan of 50 to 60 years, so DNA test is being conducted to explore
              the cause of death, including the possibility of inbreeding degeneration.

            <h2 class="characteristics">Description:</h2>
            <p class="description">The Javan rhino is smaller than the Indian rhinoceros, and is close in size to the
              black rhinoceros. It is the largest animal in Java and the second-largest animal in Indonesia after
              the Asian elephant. The length of the Javan rhino including its head is 2 to 4 metres (6.5 to 13 feet),
              and it can reach a height of 1.4–1.7 m (4.6–5.6 ft). Adults are variously reported to weigh between 900
              and 2,300 kg (1,980 and 5,070 lb), although a study to collect accurate measurements of the animals has
              never been conducted and is not a priority because of their extreme conservation status. No
              substantial size difference is seen between genders, but females may be slightly bigger. The rhinos in
              Vietnam appeared to be significantly smaller than those in Java, based on studies of photographic
              evidence and measurements of their footprints.
              Like the Indian rhino, the Javan rhinoceros has a single horn (the other extant species have two horns).
              Its horn is the smallest of all extant rhinos, usually less than 20 cm (7.9 in) with the longest
              recorded only 27 cm (11 in). Only males have horns. Female Javan rhinos are the only extant rhinos that
              remain hornless into adulthood, though they may develop a tiny bump of an inch or two in height. The
              Javan rhinoceros does not appear to often use its horn for fighting but instead uses it to scrape mud
              away in wallows, to pull down plants for eating, and to open paths through thick vegetation. Similar to
              the other browsing species of rhino (Black and Sumatran), the Javan rhino has a long, pointed, upper lip
              which helps in grabbing food. Its lower incisors are long and sharp; when the Javan rhino fights, it
              uses these teeth. Behind the incisors, two rows of six low-crowned molars are used for chewing coarse
              plants. Like all rhinos, the Javan rhino smells and hears well, but has very poor vision. They are
              estimated to live for 30 to 45 years.
              Its hairless, splotchy gray or gray-brown skin falls in folds to the shoulder, back and rump. The skin
              has a natural mosaic pattern, which lends the rhino an armored appearance. The neck folds of the Javan
              rhinoceros are smaller than those of the Indian rhinoceros, but still, form a saddle shape over the
              shoulder. Because of the risks of interfering with such an endangered species, however, the Javan
              rhinoceros is primarily studied through fecal sampling and Camera traps. They are rarely encountered,
              observed or measured directly.</p>

            <h2 class="threats">Behavior:</h2>
            <p class="description">The Javan rhinoceros is a solitary animal with the exception of breeding pairs and
              mothers with calves. They sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud
              wallows. Wallowing in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain cool
              body temperatures and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation. The Javan rhinoceros does not
              generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals' wallows or naturally occurring pits,
              which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks are also very important because of the essential
              nutrients the rhino receives from the salt. Male home ranges are larger at 12–20 km (7.5–12.4 mi)²)
              compared to the female, which are around 3–14 km (1.9–8.7 mi)²). Male territories overlap each other
              less than those of the female. It is not known if there are territorial fights.
              Males mark their territories with dung piles and by urine spraying. Scrapes made by the feet in the
              ground and twisted saplings also seem to be used for communication. Members of other rhino species have
              a peculiar habit of defecating in massive rhino dung piles and then scraping their back feet in the
              dung. The Sumatran and Javan rhinos, while defecating in piles, do not engage in the scraping. This
              adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological; in the wet forests of Java and Sumatra, the method
              may not be useful for spreading odors. The Javan rhino is much less vocal than the Sumatran; very few
              Javan rhino vocalizations have ever been recorded. Adults have no known predators other than humans. The
              species, particularly in Vietnam, is skittish and retreats into dense forests whenever humans are near.
              Though a valuable trait from a survival standpoint, it has made the rhinos difficult to
              study. Nevertheless, when humans approach too closely, the Javan rhino becomes aggressive and will
              attack, stabbing with the incisors of its lower jaw while thrusting upward with its head. Its
              comparatively antisocial behavior may be a recent adaptation to population stresses; historical evidence
              suggests they, like other rhinos, were once more gregarious.

            <p class="description">The <b>tiger</b> (Panthera tigris) is the largest species among
              the Felidae and classified in the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on
              reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such
              as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large
              contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger
              cubs
              stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home
              range to establish their own.
              The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin, and in
              the
              south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands. Since the early 20th century,
              tiger
              populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and Central
              Asia,
              from the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. Today's tiger
              range
              is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on
              the Indian
              subcontinent and Sumatra. The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986. As of 2015,
              the
              global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, down from
              around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small
              pockets
              isolated from each other. Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction, habitat
              fragmentation and poaching. This, coupled with the fact that it lives in some of the more densely
              populated
              places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.
              The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It featured
              prominently in ancient mythology and folklore and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature,
              appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams. The tiger is the national
              animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.

            <h2 class="characteristics">Characteristics:</h2>
            <p class="description">The tiger has a muscular body with powerful forelimbs, a large head and a tail that
              is
              about half the length of its body. Its pelage is dense and heavy, and colouration varies between shades of
              orange and brown with white ventralareas and distinctive vertical black stripes that are unique in each
              individual. Stripes are likely advantageous for camouflage in vegetation such as long grass with strong
              vertical
              patterns of light and shade. The tiger is one of only a few striped cat species; it is not known why
              spotted
              patterns and rosettes are the more common camouflage pattern among felids. A tiger's coat pattern is still
              visible when it is shaved. This is not due to skin pigmentation, but to the stubble and hair
              follicles embedded
              in the skin, similar to human beards (colloquially five o'clock shadow), and is in common with other big
              cats. They have a mane-like heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long whiskers, especially in
              males.
              The pupils are circular with yellow irises. The small, rounded ears have a prominent white spot on the
              back,
              surrounded by black. These spots are thought to play an important role in intraspecific communication.</p>
            <h6>Size</h6>
            <p>There is a notable sexual dimorphism between males and females, with the latter being consistently
              smaller than
              males. The size difference between males and females is proportionally greater in the large tiger
              subspecies,
              with males weighing up to 1.7 times more than females. Males also have wider forepaw pads than females,
              enabling
              sex to be told from tracks.[56] It has been hypothesised that body size of different tiger populations may
              be
              correlated with climate and be explained by thermoregulation and Bergmann's rule, or by distribution and
              size of
              available prey species.
              Generally, males vary in total length from 250 to 390 cm (8.2 to 12.8 ft) and weigh between 90 and 306 kg
              (198
              and 675 lb) with skull length ranging from 316 to 383 mm (12.4 to 15.1 in). Females vary in total length
              from
              200 to 275 cm (6.56 to 9.02 ft), weigh 65 to 167 kg (143 to 368 lb) with skull length ranging from 268 to
              318 mm
              (0.879 to 1.043 ft). In either sex, the tail represents about 0.6 to 1.1 m (24 to 43 in) of total length.
              The
              Bengal and Siberian tigers are amongst the tallest cats in shoulder height. They are also ranked among the
              biggest cats that have ever existed. The tigers of the Sunda islands are smaller and less heavy than
              tigers in
              mainland Asia, rarely exceeding 142 kg (313 lb) in weight.
              Large male Siberian tigers reach a total length of more than 3.5 m (11.5 ft) over curves and 3.3 m
              (10.8 ft) between the pegs, with a weight of up to at least 300 kg (660 lb. This is considerably larger
              than the
              weight of 75 to 140 kg (165 to 309 lb) reached by the Sumatran tiger. At the shoulder, tigers may
              variously
              stand 0.7 to 1.22 m (2.3 to 4.0 ft) tall. Bengal tiger males attain a total nose-to-tail length of 270 to
              310 cm
              (110 to 120 in) and weigh between 180 to 258 kg (397 to 569 lb), while females range from 240 to 265 cm
              (94 to
              104 in) and 100 to 160 kg (220 to 350 lb). In northern India and Nepal, the average is larger; males weigh
              up to
              235 kg (518 lb), while females average 140 kg (310 lb). Recorded body weights of wild individuals indicate
              that
              they are heavier than wild Siberian tigers.
              The Siberian tiger is often considered to be the biggest tiger. The heaviest captive tiger was a Siberian
              tiger
              which weighed 465 kg (1,025 lb). However, the largest wild tiger ever reported was a Bengal tiger
              from north
              Indiawhich was shot in 1967. It had a total body length of 3.38 m (11.1 ft) over curves, and allegedly
              weighed
              388.7 kg (857 lb), though it had a heavy meal before it was killed, without which it would have weighed
              significantly less. The longest tiger skull was 16.25 in (413 mm) measured "over the bone"; this
              individual was
              shot in 1927 in northern India. </p>
            <h6>Colour variations</h6>
            <p>The white tiger lacks yellow pigments, and has dark sepia-brown stripes and blue eyes. This altered
              pigmentation is caused by a mutant gene that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, which is
              determined
              by a white locus. It is not an albino, as the black pigments are scarcely affected. The mutation changes a
              single amino acid in the transporter protein SLC45A2. Both parents need to have the allele for whiteness
              to have
              white cubs. Between the early and mid 20th century, white tigers were recorded and shot in the Indian
              states
              of Odisha, Bihar, Assam and in the area of Rewa, Madhya Pradesh. The local maharaja started breeding
              tigers in
              the early 1950s and kept a white male tiger together with its normal-coloured daughter; they had white
              cubs. To
              preserve this recessive trait, only a few white individuals were used in captive breeding, which led to a
              high
              degree of inbreeding. Inbreeding depressionis the main reason for many health problems of captive white
              tigers,
              including strabismus, stillbirth, deformities and premature death. Other physical defects include cleft
              palate and scoliosis.
              The snow white tiger is a morph with extremely faint stripes and a pale reddish-brown ringed tail.
              The golden
              tiger has a pale golden pelage with a blond tone and reddish-brown stripes. Both snow white and golden
              tigers
              are homozygous for CORIN gene mutations. These morphs are rarely recorded in the wild.</p>

            <h2 class="threats">Biology and behaviour</h2>

            <p class="description">When not subject to human disturbance, the tiger is mainly diurnal. It does not often
              climb
              trees but cases have been recorded. It is a strong swimmer and often bathes in ponds, lakes and rivers,
              thus
              keeping cool in the heat of the day. Individuals can cross rivers up to 7 km (4.3 mi) wide and can swim up
              to
              29 km (18 mi) in a day.[83] During the 1980s, a tiger was observed frequently hunting prey through deep
              lake
              water in Ranthambhore National Park.
              The tiger is a long-ranging species, and individuals disperse over distances of up to 650 km (400 mi) to
              reach
              tiger populations in other areas. Radio-collared tigers in Chitwan National Park started dispersing from
              their
              natal areas earliest at the age of 19 months. Four females dispersed between 0 and 43.2 km (0.0 and
              26.8 mi),
              and 10 males between 9.5 and 65.7 km (5.9 and 40.8 mi). None of them crossed open cultivated areas that
              were
              more than 10 km (6.2 mi) wide, but moved through forested habitat.
              Adult tigers lead largely solitary lives. They establish and maintain territories but have much wider home
              ranges within which they roam. Resident adults of either sex generally confine their movements to their
              home
              ranges, within which they satisfy their needs and those of their growing cubs. Individuals sharing the
              same area
              are aware of each other's movements and activities. The size of the home range mainly depends on prey
              abundance,
              geographic area and sex of the individual. In India, home ranges appear to be 50 to 1,000 km2 (19 to
              386 sq mi)
              while in Manchuria, they range from 500 to 4,000 km2 (190 to 1,540 sq mi). In Nepal, defended territories
              are
              recorded to be 19 to 151 km2 (7.3 to 58.3 sq mi) for males and 10 to 51 km2 (3.9 to 19.7 sq mi) for
              females.
              Young female tigers establish their first territories close to their mother's. The overlap between the
              female
              and her mother's territory reduces with time. Males, however, migrate further than their female
              counterparts and
              set out at a younger age to mark out their own area. A young male acquires territory either by seeking out
              an
              area devoid of other male tigers, or by living as a transient in another male's territory until he is
              older and
              strong enough to challenge the resident male. Young males seeking to establish themselves thereby comprise
              the
              highest mortality rate (30–35% per year) amongst adult tigers.
              To identify his territory, the male marks trees by spraying urine and anal gland secretions, as well as
              marking
              trails with scat and marking trees or the ground with their claws. Females also use these "scrapes", as
              well as
              urine and scat markings. Scent markings of this type allow an individual to pick up information on
              another's
              identity, sex and reproductive status. Females in oestrus will signal their availability by scent marking
              more
              frequently and increasing their vocalisations.
              Although for the most part avoiding each other, tigers are not always territorial and relationships
              between
              individuals can be complex. An adult of either sex will sometimes share its kill with others, even those
              who may
              not be related to them. George Schaller observed a male share a kill with two females and four cubs.
              Unlike male
              lions, male tigers allow females and cubs to feed on the kill before the male is finished with it; all
              involved
              generally seem to behave amicably, in contrast to the competitive behaviour shown by a lion
              pride.[90] Stephen
              Mills described a social feeding event in Ranthambhore National Park:
              A dominant tigress they called Padmini killed a 250 kg (550 lb) male nilgai – a very large antelope. They
              found
              her at the kill just after dawn with her three 14-month-old cubs, and they watched uninterrupted for the
              next
              ten hours. During this period the family was joined by two adult females and one adult male, all offspring
              from
              Padmini's previous litters, and by two unrelated tigers, one female the other unidentified. By three
              o'clock
              there were no fewer than nine tigers round the kill. Occasionally, male tigers participate in raising
              cubs,
              usually their own, but this is extremely rare and not always well understood. In May 2015, Amur tigers
              were
              photographed by camera traps in the Sikhote-Alin Bioshpere Reserve. The photos show a male Amur tiger pass
              by,
              followed by a female and three cubs within the span of about two minutes. In Ranthambore, a male Bengal
              tiger
              raised and defended two orphaned female cubs after their mother had died of illness. The cubs remained
              under his
              care, he supplied them with food, protected them from his rival and sister, and apparently also trained
              them.
              Male tigers are generally more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of
              other
              females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright
              aggression.
              Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto
              its back
              and showing its belly in a submissive posture. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a
              subordinate within his range, as long as they do not live in too close quarters. The most aggressive
              disputes
              tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and sometimes resulted in the death of one of
              the
              males. Facial expressions include the "defense threat", where an individual bares its teeth, flattens its
              ears
              and its pupils enlarge. Both males and females show a flehmen response, a characteristic grimace, when
              sniffing
              urine markings, but flehmen is more often associated with males detecting the markings made by tigresses
              in
              oestrus. Like other Panthera, tigers roar, particularly in aggressive situations, during the mating season
              or
              when making a kill. There are two different roars: the "true" roar is made using the hyoid apparatus and
              forced
              through an open mouth as it progressively closes, and the shorter, harsher "coughing" roar is made with
              the
              mouth open and teeth exposed. The "true" roar can be heard at up to 3 km (1.9 mi) away and is sometimes
              emitted
              three or four times in succession. When tense, tigers will moan, a sound similar to a roar but more
              subdued and
              made when the mouth is partially or completely closed. Moaning can be heard 400 m (1,300 ft)
              away. Chuffing—soft, low-frequency snorting similar to purring in smaller cats—is heard in more friendly
              situations. Other vocal communications include grunts, woofs, snarls, miaows, hisses and growls.</p>

            <h6>Poaching</h6>
            <p>Poaching of leopards is a main threat to their survival. There are rumours but no evidence that Chinese
              traders
              buy leopard skins; no skins were confiscated at borders to China. In 14 months from February 2002 to April
              2003,
              seven skins or part of skins were confiscated, six in Russia and one in China. Leopards are most often
              killed by
              local Russians from small villages in and around the leopard habitat. Most of these villagers hunt
              entirely
              illegally; they have no licenses for hunting nor for their guns, and they are not members of one of the
              local
              hunting leases.
              In 1999, skins of poached leopards were offered for $500–1,000 near a protected area in Russia.</p>

            <h2>Enemies and competitors:</h2>


            <p>Tigers usually prefer to eat prey they have caught themselves, but are not above eating carrion in times
              of
              scarcity and may even pirate prey from other large carnivores. Although predators typically avoid one
              another,
              if a prey item is under dispute or a serious competitor is encountered, displays of aggression are common.
              If
              these are not sufficient, the conflicts may turn violent; tigers may kill competitors
              as leopards, dholes, striped hyenas, wolves, bears, pythons, and crocodiles on occasion. Tigers may also
              prey on
              these competitors. Attacks on smaller predators, such as badgers, lynxes, and foxes, are almost certainly
              predatory. Crocodiles, bears, and large packs of dholes may win conflicts against tigers and in some cases
              even
              kill them.
              The considerably smaller leopard avoids competition from tigers by hunting at different times of the day
              and
              hunting different prey.In India's Nagarhole National Park, most prey selected by leopards were from 30 to
              175 kg
              (66 to 386 lb) against a preference for prey weighing over 176 kg (388 lb) in the tigers. The average prey
              weight in the two respective big cats in India was 37.6 kg (83 lb) against 91.5 kg (202 lb). With
              relatively
              abundant prey, tigers and leopards were seen to successfully coexist without competitive exclusion or
              interspecies dominance hierarchies that may be more common to the African savanna, where the leopard
              exists with
              the lion.Golden jackals may feed on the tiger's kills. Tigers appear to inhabit the deep parts of a forest
              while
              smaller predators like leopards and dholes are pushed closer to the fringes.

            <h2>In captivity:</h2>
            <p>In Ancient Roman times, tigers were kept in menageries and amphitheatres to be exhibited, trained and
              paraded,
              and were often provoked to fight humans and exotic beasts. Since the 17th century, tigers, being rare and
              ferocious, were sought after to keep at European castles as symbols of their owners' power. Tigers became
              central zoo and circus exhibits in the 18th century: a tiger could cost up to 4,000 francs in France (for
              comparison, a professor of the Beaux-Arts at Lyons earned only 3,000 francs a year), or up to $3,500 in
              the
              United States, where a lion cost no more than $1,000.
              China (2007) had over 4,000 captive tigers, of which 3,000 were held by about twenty larger facilities,
              with the
              rest held by some 200 smaller facilities. The USA (2011) had 2,884 tigers in 468 facilities. Nineteen
              states
              have banned private ownership of tigers, fifteen require a license, and sixteen states have no
              regulation. Genetic ancestry of 105 captive tigers from fourteen countries and regions showed that
              forty-nine
              animals belonged distinctly to five subspecies; fifty-two animals had mixed subspecies origins. As such,
              "many
              Siberian tigers in zoos today are actually the result of crosses with Bengal tigers."
              The Tiger Species Survival Plan has condemned the breeding of white tigers, alleging they are of mixed
              ancestry
              and of unknown lineage. The genes responsible for white colouration are represented by 0.001% of the
              population.
              The disproportionate growth in numbers of white tigers points
              to inbreeding among homozygous recessive individuals. This would lead to inbreeding depression and loss
              of genetic variability.
